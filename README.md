# Analyzing League of Legends match data using `datreant`

This repo gives a demo for how [`datreant`](http://datreant.org/) can be used to analyze a dataset organized in a traditional filesystem.
The dataset comes courtesy of Alyssa Adams (@alyssa-adams), using Riot Games' public API for pulling League of Legends match data.

This demo was presented to Sarah Walker's research group on Jan 26, 2017.
In it, we explore questions around banning of characters in a match, and the effect this has on a team's chances at winning or losing.
We don't conclusively answer any questions, but instead showcase how rapid exploration of many questions can be done using `datreant` and [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
